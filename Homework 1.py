>>> #Problem 2
>>> #The addition symbol can be used to add strings together for example:
>>> print ("Happy" + "day")
Happyday
>>> first = "Happy"
>>> second = "day"
>>> first + second
'Happyday'
>>> print (first + second)
Happyday
>>> print ("happy, day")
happy, day
>>> print ("today", "is", "a", "good", "day")
today is a good day
>>> #The addition operator adds the strings whereas the comma operator keeps them separate.
>>> #Problem 3
>>> #There are built-in functions that you can use to turn your argument into the function's type.
>>> int (3.5)
3
>>> #the interger functions turns the argument into an integer.
>>> float (4)
4.0
>>> #the float function turns the argument into a decimal (known as float).
>>> str ("wednesday")

>>> #the string function turns the argument into a string.
>>> str ("4")
'4'
>>> bool (1)
True
>>> bool (0)
False
>>> #the bool function turns the argument into True or False.

Blue waves whitened on a cliff
 Soaring fire that sways and sings
And children's faces looking up
 Holding wonder like a cup
